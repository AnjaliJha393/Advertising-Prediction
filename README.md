# Advertising-Prediction
### Objective:-
In order to predict where to invest more for adversting either on TV,radio or newspaper and how much to invest among the given features such that we get more profitable results.
###### before applying algorithms we need to perform EDA to check null values and correlations in the dataset.
###### with the help of matplotlib library for visualization of the data is done. 
#### Algorithms applied:
###### Linear Regression trained and tested the model
###### Linear asssumptions also perfomed but was not satisfied by the dataset
###### Polynomial regression applied as the assumptions were not fulfilled and also for improvising our results i.e the score of prediction .
